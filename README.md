Moonshine Technology Private Limited is operating on the Indian market of mobile poker.
For the past years, our company has become a leader in the industry, but the invasion of
foreign capital has greatly aggravated competition. The demand for quality has increased
significantly and therefore a decision was made to develop a new mobile application.

Of course, developing a best-in-class app requires a lot of things: intuitive and pleasant UI,
beautiful animations at 60 fps, uncompromised performance even on low-end devices, fast
interaction with the backend, responsiveness for supporting all possible screen sizes and
resolutions and much more. Given all the above, a decision was made to build up a strong
team of senior React Native developers.

To confirm your experience, you need to solve the problem of medium complexity, which will
be as close as possible to the real tasks of the project. While evaluating your work, the following
criteria will be considered:

- Is your code clear, clean, and maintainable?
- Did you pay attention to tiny details while doing this work?
- Does your code respect modern standards and project conventions?
- Does your solution have the responsiveness and support of different devices?
- How well is your solution optimized and performs on low-end devices?

These are important, but not the only criteria that will apply. To make a long story short,
imagine that your goal is to say “I do care about the quality at every level” through your code.
Being an experienced developer, we’ll never miss a thing if you do.

YOUR ASSIGNMENT TASK FOLLOWS:

You are given a base project with the only screen partially implemented. The problem is this
screen of game table categories has no animations at all. Your goal is to implement missing
animations, improve the overall quality of this screen, and make it production-ready. Binding data
to the backend is not required.

Particularly, you are expected to implement a filter transition animation in a list of the game table
categories:

- Items that are missing in a newly selected filter, should move left and disappear behind the edge of the screen
- Items that are new in a newly selected filter, should also move left appearing from the right edge of the screen
- The whole animation should run for 500ms and have no lags or janks
- The transition of all list items should run simultaneously in one pass

Feel free to include any improvements to the project you find reasonable.

If you have any questions related to this task, send all of them in a batch to Skype ID: sergeymorkovkin
Once your solution is ready, create “[first]-[last].zip” and send to sergey@moonshinetechnology.com

Good luck!
